      <p class="font-sans text-sm first-letter:font-serif first-letter:text-3xl">In a momentous decision that combines resolute determination and thoughtful contemplation, the United States has officially abandoned its neutral stance toward the ongoing global conflict in Europe. President Woodrow Wilson addressed a formal request to Congress, urging a declaration of war against Germany.</p>
      <p class="font-sans text-sm">This historic turning point follows months of intense debate and mounting tensions with the German Empire. Several factors played a critical role in pushing the nation towards this consequential decision. Of notable significance was Germany's announcement of unrestricted submarine warfare, a policy that jeopardized American maritime interests and the lives of American citizens.</p>
      <br />
      <p class="font-sans text-sm">President Wilson's eloquent address to Congress presented the multifaceted motivations behind this momentous step. He invoked the principles of democracy, peace, and freedom while emphasizing America's moral responsibility as a nation to stand by its European allies.</p>
      <br />
      <p class="font-sans text-sm">The response from Congress to President Wilson's call was overwhelmingly in favor of war. The resolution, declaring "that a state of war exists between the United States of America and Germany," passed with unanimous approval in the Senate and a resounding majority in the House of Representatives. This united front in Congress signifies the deep-seated conviction shared among the nation's lawmakers.</p>
      <br />
      <p class="font-sans text-sm">This decision marks the dawning of a new era for America, one that places the United States on the global stage with a prominent role to play in the pursuit of world peace. However, it also raises pivotal questions about the nation's preparedness for the war effort, the preservation of civil liberties, and the collective burden that this war will place on society. In the weeks ahead, it is imperative that every American citizen rallies behind this national commitment to the Great War, comprehending the sacrifices it will demand. As America steps onto the world's battlefield, the future remains uncertain, but the hope of ending this devastating conflict and establishing lasting peace continues to guide our nation.</p>
